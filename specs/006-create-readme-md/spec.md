# Feature Specification: Create README.md

**Feature Branch**: `006-create-readme-md`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create README.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or user exploring this project, I need a comprehensive README.md file that explains what the project is, how to set it up, and how to use it, so that I can quickly understand and get started with the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer visits the project repository, **When** they view the README.md file, **Then** they should understand the project's purpose and main features
2. **Given** a developer wants to use the project, **When** they follow the installation instructions in README.md, **Then** they should be able to successfully set up the project locally
3. **Given** a user wants to understand project capabilities, **When** they read the usage examples in README.md, **Then** they should be able to perform basic operations with the project

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has different operating system requirements?
- How does the README handle different skill levels (beginner vs advanced users)?
- What if the project has complex dependencies or prerequisites?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: README.md MUST provide a clear project title and brief description
- **FR-002**: README.md MUST include installation/setup instructions
- **FR-003**: README.md MUST contain basic usage examples or getting started guide
- **FR-004**: README.md MUST list project features and capabilities
- **FR-005**: README.md MUST include contribution guidelines [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: contribution process not specified]
- **FR-006**: README.md MUST specify license information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: license type not specified]
- **FR-007**: README.md MUST provide contact or support information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: support channels not specified]
- **FR-008**: README.md MUST include project status or roadmap [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: current project maturity not specified]
- **FR-009**: README.md MUST list prerequisites and dependencies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: technical requirements not specified]
- **FR-010**: README.md MUST be formatted in proper Markdown syntax

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **README.md File**: The main documentation file containing project information, setup instructions, usage examples, and metadata
- **Project Information**: Title, description, purpose, and key features of the project
- **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step guide for installing and configuring the project
- **Usage Examples**: Code snippets and examples demonstrating how to use the project
